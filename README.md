## About Me:
I am a senior in the CS, with a minor in Japanese. I love to program and have been doing so since I was in middle school. I enjoy making small games to test out concepts, and reading fantasy books. I am the fifth in my familiy, and I love spending time with them when I can. I had the privilage to live in the Kyushuu area of Japan for two years doing voluenteer service for my church. I love teaching and helping those around me and I take every oportunity I can to do so.
