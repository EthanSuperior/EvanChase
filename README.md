## About Me:
I am a senior in computer science, with a minor in Japanese. I love to program and have been doing so since I was in middle school. I enjoy making small games to test out concepts and reading fantasy books. I am the fifth in my family, and I love spending time with them when I can. I had the privilege to live in the Kyushu area of Japan for two years doing volunteer service for my church. I love teaching and helping those around me, and I take every opportunity I can to do so.
